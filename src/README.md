# Mlite UI Components

This is a UI Component Library which I've started mainly rebuild my [homepage](https://mprieto.me) and to use it in [my blog](https://mprieto.me/blog).

### Updates

**2020-07-26**

Just getting started. I'm mostly trying the setup of things

I started the project using [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library). It's pretty cool.

Added a few components, storybook and other stuff to it.
